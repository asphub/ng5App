## Tutorial - steps

### Step 1
Install Angular via CLI.
```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

### Step 2
Create a new project
```bash
ng new ng5crud
```

### Step 3
Make three components of the application.

Create one directory inside src  >>  app folder called components.
```bash
ng g c index
ng g c create
ng g c edit
```
We have created three components. Each component will do its job. Here we are establishing the single responsibility principle for every component.

It makes a separate folder inside src  >>  app directory. We need to move all these three folders inside components folder.

Also, we need to change the app.module.ts file, to write the correct path of the imported components. By default, itâ€™s an app directory.
